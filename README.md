## About

### What's Samba ?

Samba is a homescreen widget developped for educational purpose and based on a joke with friends.

### What does it do ?

When you click on it, it starts a funny little song which only repeats "On s'en bat les couilles" which can be translated to "We don't give a fuck". And it smiles :)

### What's the meaning of life ?

Dunno, sorry.
